### <p align="justify">Here we are trying to predict the Close Value which refers to the closing price of the particular Netflix stock on a given trading day. We are specifically using Linear Regression (Multi-Linear) with parameters - Open, High, Low, Volume. Our model is very accurate at predicting the closing price of the Netflix stocks given the previous mentioned parameters. The comparative analysis shows the values obtained by the regression model which gives MSE = <em>14.122</em>, RMSE = <em>3.758</em>, and R2 Score = <em>0.999</em></p>
